**Executive Summary**

Airbnb is a growing online marketplace that offers homestays. Along with being a stock market unicorn, its popularity has accelerated over the past few years. Meanwhile, investors are constantly on a lookout for places to invest in. With this project, we aimed at guiding investors to invest in places that have a high booking rate. 


We focussed on Miami city, one of the most widely popular and visited cities in the world!
Miami attracts visitors for its countless beaches, tropical weather, and tourist sites. Besides being a vacation place, it attracts business travellers as Miami holds conventions and conferences all year long. We believe this to be a cause for strong demand and high-occupancy rate. 

Although Location is one of the key factors in investing, our project aims at digging deep in the factors involved for the success of an investment. 

There exists 1 Master Script that:

Loads Dataset and Installs and loads required libraries.
Shows exploratory data analysis.
Performs data cleaning and data preprocessing.
Shows model testing.
Includes the conclusion and summary.
Writes the new cleaned and joined files to csv (redundant backups).

Guidelines:

Master Script is to be run once per session.
To check any model, the entire script is to be run.

Data Description :
In total we had 66 variables.
Training dataset: 6195 rows.
Test dataset: 2065.

Result & Model Summaries:
-Data Cleaning is more important as compared to modelling.
-Understanding variables is better than following the accuracy. 
-Some values were not easy to work with - Not all values could be replaced with a median.
