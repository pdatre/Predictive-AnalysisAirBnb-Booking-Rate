**Executive Summary**

Airbnb is a growing online marketplace that offers homestays. Along with being a stock market unicorn, its popularity has accelerated over the past few years. Meanwhile, investors are constantly on a lookout for places to invest in. With this project, we aimed at guiding investors to invest in places that have a high booking rate. 


We focussed on Miami city, one of the most widely popular and visited cities in the world!
Miami attracts visitors for its countless beaches, tropical weather, and tourist sites. Besides being a vacation place, it attracts business travellers as Miami holds conventions and conferences all year long. We believe this to be a cause for strong demand and high-occupancy rate. 

Although Location is one of the key factors in investing, our project aims at digging deep in the factors involved for the success of an investment.
